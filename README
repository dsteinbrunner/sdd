sdd is Shut Down Daemon

It is a Linux service to ensure a server shuts down as soon as it can.

Typical usage: a home NAS which is turned on when needed, but should shut down automatically when no users are using it any more.

Services monitored:
  SSH - will only shut down when no users are logged on to the machine
  smb - will only shut down when there are no file locks open.

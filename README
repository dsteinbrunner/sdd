sdd is Shut Down Daemon

It is a Linux service to ensure a server shuts down as soon as it can.

Typical usage: a home NAS which is turned on when needed, but should shut down automatically when no users are using it any more.

Set hard disk spindown with hdparm:

  hdparm -S <Int>

or with /etc/hdparm.conf

  /dev/sdb {
    spindown_time = 240
  }

See man page for hdparm for details of spindown_time.

See example config.yml file for configuration options, or application help:

  sdd --help
